System Requirements
===================

The USB REVue toolset was developed and tested under Ubuntu 10.04 and 11.04.
Some aspects work in 10.04 and some are known to not work. For other distros,
YMMV, depending on whether the minimum requirements are met.

    * tcpdump (corresponding with libpcap)
    * libpcap 1.1.0 (1.0.0 is known to not work)
        - 1.0.0 uses the read(2) interface to usbmon, which does not result in
          a complete capture.
    * python-pcapy
    * python-qt4
