USBREVue is a suite of tools for reverse-engineering USB devices.

USBREVue provides the following tools:

    * Grapher: Visually track USB packet data values
    * Modifier: Programmatically modify a stream of USB packets
    * Replayer: Send a specified stream of USB packets to a USB device
    * Statisfier: Perform basic statistical analysis on a stream of
      		  USB packets
   
    * Viewer: Edit and view a stream of USB packets

There are plans to add USB decoding to the Viewer in a future release
of USBREVue. Until then, for analysis of USB packets according to the
USB protocol, we highly recommend recent versions of Wireshark, a
network protocol analyzer for Unix and Windows. You can learn more
about Wireshark at www.wireshark.org.
