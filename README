===================
System Requirements
===================

The USB REVue toolset was developed and tested under Ubuntu 10.04 and 11.04.
Some aspects work in 10.04 and some are known to not work. For other distros,
YMMV, depending on whether the minimum requirements are met.

    * tcpdump (corresponding with libpcap)
    * libpcap 1.1.0 (1.0.0 is known to not work)
        - 1.0.0 uses the read(2) interface to usbmon, which does not result in
          a complete capture.
    * python-pcapy
    * python-qt4

In addition, for usbreplay, ensure that pyusb-1.0.0 is inserted into the 
python tree.  For example, on some linux systems, a good location would be:
/usr/lib/python2.7.  pyusb, for example, allows imports of usb.core and 
usb.util. 



======
Viewer
======

The viewer allows the user to view, edit, annotate, and analyze a USB packet
stream.

1. USAGE

To view a pcap file:

        $ ./usbview.py < file.pcap

To view a live stream, and dump to a file:

        $ sudo tcpdump -i usbmon0u -w - -U | ./usbview.py -p > outfile.pcap

The -p option enables 'passthru' -- all incoming packets will be dumped to 
output as they arrive.

2. FILTERING

The viewer provides filtering of displayed and captured packets using user-
provided Python expressions. All fields of the usbmon_packet struct are
available (see section "THE USB PACKET" below).

The capture filter instructs the viewer to ignore any incoming packets for
which the filter expression returns False. The display filter expression is
used to determine which packets are visible in the view. Use the capture
filter to remove packets you will never be interested in; use the display
filter to focus on the packets you are interested in right now.

A typical capture filter might look like

        devnum == 3 and xfer_type != isochronous

This will ignore traffic to all devices but device 3, and will remove any
isochronous packets from the captured stream.

Examples of display filter expressions:

    * Show traffic from endpoint 0x81 (mind the hex!)
        epnum == 0x81

    * Show setup packets
        setup

    * Show setup packets with a bmRequestType type of 'vendor'
        setup.bmRequestTypeType == 'vendor'

    * Show packets with a data payload
        data

    * Show errors
        event_type == 'E'

    * Show callbacks from interrupt endpoints
        event_type == 'C' and xfer_type == interrupt

3. ANNOTATIONS

At the bottom of the window is a text field for inserting annotations into a
live packet stream. To use this, just type something into it and press enter.
Note that there is currently no way to preserve annotations across sessions.

4. EDITING

Double-clicking existing packet data allows it to be edited. The editor only
accepts hexadecimal characters as input, and does not allow the length of the
data to be changed.

5. DUMPING

Selected packets can be dumped to standard output, either for writing packets
to a pcap file or for interaction with other tools. To do this, select one or
more packets in the list, right click, and choose 'Dump selected'.

Note that dumping will do nothing if standard output is not redirected or piped
on the command line.

6. CODE GENERATION

The viewer supports limited code translation of packets. A selection of
packets can be translated into the libusb C code that would replicate them by
choosing 'Copy as libusb code' from the context menu.

An example of generated code for an incoming control transfer:

if ((err = libusb_control_transfer(handle, 0xa1, 0xfe, 0x0, 0x0, data, 1, TIMEOUT)) < 0)
	handle_error(err);

Note that this assumes the existence of a number of variables and constants:
 
    * 'handle' is an open libusb device handle
    * 'err' is an integer
    * 'data' is a character array large enough to contain the data (in this
      case, it need only be one byte long)
    * 'TIMEOUT' is an integer
    * 'handle_error' is a function or macro that deals with an error code

Outgoing packets use string literals for the data, and expect 'n_transferred'
to be defined as an integer. Code formatting and names are not currently
configurable.

Note that any reference to device and bus number are lost in the translation.
If you attempt to generate code for a selection that includes multiple devices,
you will receive a warning saying so. (The code is still generated, just in
case you know what you're doing.)

7. OPTIONS

'Passthru' dumps incoming packets as soon as they're received. It is disabled
by default, but can be enabled using the -p command-line option.

'Autoscroll' ensures that the most recently captured packet is visible in the
display. It is disabled by default.

Both options can be toggled from the context menu. Note that these are only
particularly useful for live captures, not for viewing prerecorded dumps.




========
Modifier
========

The purpose of the Modifier is to alter packets programmatically. It
allows the user to apply a function to every packet in the input
stream and writes the modifier packets as output.

1. GETTING STARTED

Like other tools in the USB REVue toolkit, the Modifier reads and
writes via a pcap-formatted stream or file. The Modifier reads from
standard input and writes to standard output. To connect an input
source and output destination, use a pipeline. For example, to read
from a pcap file called "foo.pcap" and write to a file called
"bar.pcap", do:

        $ cat foo.pcap | ./modifier.py > bar.pcap

To read a pcap stream directly from USB bus 7, do:
   
        $ sudo tcpdump -i usbmon7u -w - -U | ./usbmodify.py[ | ...]

Note that if no output destination is given, all packets will be
silently lost.


2. THE USB PACKET

USB REVue uses a USB packet class based on the usbmon_packet C struct
described in the usbmon documentation. Each packet contains the
following typed attributes (usbmon_packet name given in parentheses
where it differs from USB REVue):

      u64	    urb			(id)
      unsigned char event_type		(type)
      unsigned char xfer_type
      unsigned char epnum
      unsigned char devnum
      u16      	    busnum
      char	    flag_setup
      char	    flag_data
      s64	    ts_sec
      s32	    ts_usec
      int	    status
      unsigned int  length
      unsigned int  len_cap
      unsigned char setup[SETUP_LEN]	-- only for Control S-type
      unsigned int  error_count		-- only for ISO
      unsigned int  numdesc		-- only for ISO
      int      	    interval
      int	    start_frame
      unsigned int  xfer_flags
      unsigned int  ndesc
      unsigned char data[...]

The data array may be of variable size, depending on the specific
packet. For more information about these attributes, see the usbmon
documentation (probably supplied with your Linux kernel documentation,
or available at
http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/usb/usbmon.txt).

Since the resulting packet must still be valid for encoding, any
modified attribute values must still be of the respective type
indicated above. For example, changing 'status' to a floating-point
number will result in an error.
      

3. ALTERING PACKETS

The Modifier requires that the user specify at the command line the
way(s) in which incoming USB packets will be modified. There are three
methods for altering USB packets, ranging from most restrictive to
most flexible: simple statements, an external routine, and an external
Python module.

With any of the above methods, to display the details of each modified
packet on the fly, use the --verbose flag.

3a. With Simple Statements (--exp)

Simple statements are designed to easily modify the data payload of a
stream of USB packets. Other packet attributes may be modified as
well, but this behavior is not supported. To use simple statements,
use the --exp flag followed by one or more quoted and comma-separated
statements:

        $ ./usbmodify.py --exp "data[0] = data[1] + data[2]","data[3]\
        = data[4] ^ data[5]"

Data payload byte offsets are referenced as "data[0], data[1],
...". Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), logical operators (and, or,
not), and bitwise operators (^, &, |, !) are supported. For logical
xor, use "bool(a) ^ bool(b)".

The statement(s) will only be applied to a USB packet if the packet's
data payload contains every byte offset referenced in ALL
statements. For example, given the two statements "data[0] = !
data[1]" and "data[2] = data[3] | data[4]", a packet must have at
least 5 data bytes for either of these statements to be applied to it. 

3b. With an External Routine (--routine)

The user can use an external routine to specify more complex
modifications. Any packet attribute may be referenced and/or
altered. The external routine must be written as a sequence of one or
more Python statements. To use an external routine, use the --routine
flag followed by the name of the file containing the routine. For
example, the following routine is saved as "mod_routine":

	 if len(data) >= 8:
	     data[7] = data[0] or data[1]
	 elif epnum == 0 && !status:
	     status = 1

The routine can be applied to all incoming packets by doing:

        $ ./usbmodify.py --routine mod_routine

Note that, unlike simple statements passed at the command line, there
is no checking done on the existence of attributes or byte offsets
before the routine is applied. Be sure to examine each packet
(e.g. using the xfer_type attribute or Python's len()) where
necessary.

For more information about Python statements, see the Python
documentation (http://docs.python.org).

3c. With a Python Module (--mod)

A user-supplied Python module is the most flexible way to modify a USB
stream. Instead of supplying a routine to be applied to each packet
automatically, the user-supplied module can add or remove packets from
the stream and save information about previous packets.

The module must be saved with a .py extension in the same directory as
usbmodify.py. To use a user-supplied module, use the --mod flag
followed by the name of the module (without the .py extension).

The module must implement a function with the following interface:

        modify(packet_gen, commit_func)

The function must take two arguments, both of them functions. The
first argument ("packet_gen") is a Python generator that supplies
individual USB packets from the incoming pcap stream/file. The second
function ("commit_func") is used to pass a packet to the output
stream.

To access the USB packet stream, use the generator passed as the first
argument:

        for packet in packet_gen():
	    ...

To pass a single packet to the output stream, use the function passed
as the second argument:

        commit_func(packet)

Note that any packet destined for output, whether modified or not,
must be passed to the commit function. To remove or ignore a packet, simply
don't pass it to the commit function.

Additionally, at any time you can create a new packet by importing
Packet from usbrevue:

        new_packet = Packet()

You can then assign values to the new packet's attributes manually.

As a simple example, the following module output all packets with epnum 1 or
2, modifies the data of packets with epnum 2, and ignores all other packets:

      """mymod.py"""

      def modifier(generator, commit):

          for packet in generator():

	      if packet.epnum == 1:
	          commit(packet)
	      elif packet.epnum == 2:
	          if len(packet.data) >= 4:
		      packet.data[3] = packet.data[0] | packet.data[1]
		  commit(packet)
	      else:
	          continue

To run this module, do:

        $ ./usbmodify.py --mod mymod
