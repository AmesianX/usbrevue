===================
System Requirements
===================

The USB REVue toolset was developed and tested under Ubuntu 10.04 and 11.04.
Some aspects work in 10.04 and some are known to not work. For other distros,
YMMV, depending on whether the minimum requirements are met.

    * tcpdump (corresponding with libpcap)
        - Needed only for capture
    * libpcap 1.1.0 (1.0.0 is known to not work)
        - 1.0.0 uses the read(2) interface to usbmon, which does not result in
          a complete capture; 1.1.0 uses the mmap(2) interface.
        - Needed by most tools
        - Ubuntu 11.04: libpcap0.8 (yes, this really is version 1.1.1)
        - Fedora 14: libpcap (1.1.1)
    * usbmon (Linux kernel)
        - Needed only for packet capture
        - Ubuntu 10.04 and later (possibly earlier): Included; needs setup
        - Fedora 14 and later (possibly earlier): Included; needs setup
        - See 'Setup usbmon' below
    * Python Modules:
        * python-pcapy
            - Needed by most tools
            - Ubuntu 10.04 and later: python-pcapy
            - Fedora 14: pcapy
        * python-qt4
            - Needed by usbgraph.py, usbstatisfier.py, usbview.py
            - Ubuntu 10.04 and later: python-qt4
            - Fedora 14: PyQt4
        * python-gflags
            - Needed by usbmodify.py, usbstatisfier.py
            - Ubuntu 11.04: python-gflags
            - Fedora 14: python-gflags
        * Qwt5
            - Needed only by usbgraph.py
            - Ubuntu 10.04 and later: python-qwt5-qt4
            - Fedora 14: PyQwt
        * pyusb 1.0.0
            - Needed only by usbreplay.py
            - Source: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyusb/
            - Ubuntu 11.04: Not currently packaged
            - Fedora 14: Not currently packaged
	* python-scapy
	    - Needed only by usbmodify.py
	    - Ubuntu 10.04 and later: python-scapy
	    - Fedora 14: 

In addition, for usbreplay, ensure that pyusb-1.0.0 is inserted into the 
python tree.  For example, on some linux systems, a good location would be:
/usr/lib/python2.7.  Pyusb, for example, allows imports of usb.core and 
usb.util.

Setup usbmon
------------

'usbmon' is a Linux-kernel USB tracing facility which is suppored by recent
versions of libpcap as a packet-source.  Many modern Linux distributions, such
as Fedora and Ubuntu, ship with usbmon enabled. Setting it up for use, however,
varies: 'debugfs' must be mounted; if 'usbmon' is built as a module, the module
must be loaded.

    * Ubuntu:
        * Module: Must be loaded
        * Debugfs: Mounted by default.
    * Fedora:
        * Module: Compiled in; no module to be loaded.
        * Debugfs: Not mounted by default.

    * Loading module:
        sudo modprobe usbmon
    * Mounting debugfs:
        sudo mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug

Installing From Source
======================

Typical Python `distutils` install:

    sudo python setup.py install
